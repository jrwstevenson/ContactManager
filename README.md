# The Gaming Innovation Group JavaScript Challenge

## Client Side Address Book
Build a [Single Page Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPA) address book using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

### Functionality
1. There should be one view where all contacts are listed.
1. There should be another view to add, delete and edit contacts.
1. The data should be persisted (on the client), and loaded again when the application starts.
1. Add fitting validation to the different input fields.

### Form Fields
* First name (input, required)
* Last name (input, required)
* Email (input[type=text], required, valid email)
* Country (dropdown, required) - use the [country-list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/country-list) module to populate the list

### Other Requirements
* Even though this is a small project, structure and architecture should mimic a large project.
* The code should obviusly follow best practises (DRY, maintainable, testable, etc.).
* Feel free to depend on any frameworks/libraries you think is suitable using NPM/Bower.
* We want the code you submit to be written by you, so don’t use skelletons/generators.
* Make sure the application work on Node 5.x, NPM 3.x and in latest Chrome and Firefox.

When you are done, send us a link to your repository on Github/Bitbucket (preferred and much faster) through [this page](https://www.gaminginnovationgroup.com/careers/tech/javascript-developer/149276/) or [e-mail](&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#114;&#x6f;&#x62;&#64;&#x62;&#101;&#x74;&#105;&#x74;&#x67;&#x72;&#x6f;&#117;&#112;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;) it directly to our CTO (not preferred, and much slower ;-).

Note, this is where you get to shine — *show us what you’ve got!*
