# SPA Contact Manager

[Working example](https://contacts.james-stevenson.com) can be found here.

For this coding challenge I chose to use React with the Context API. Redux could easily be implemented for a larger app.

Webpack and Babel configurations are courtesy of Create React App.

I have used Sass as the CSS preprocessor.

Data is persisted by utilizing the browsers local storage.

### Extra features

1. Sample data can be loaded to give 11 examples.
1. Search facility.
1. Fields for Avatar and Phone Number.

## Client Side Address Book

Build a [Single Page Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPA) address book using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

### Functionality

1. There should be one view where all contacts are listed.
1. There should be another view to add, delete and edit contacts.
1. The data should be persisted (on the client), and loaded again when the application starts.
1. Add fitting validation to the different input fields.

### Form Fields

- First name (input, required)
- Last name (input, required)
- Email (input[type=text], required, valid email)
- Country (dropdown, required) - use the [country-list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/country-list) module to populate the list

### Other Requirements

- Even though this is a small project, structure and architecture should mimic a large project.
- The code should obviusly follow best practises (DRY, maintainable, testable, etc.).
- Feel free to depend on any frameworks/libraries you think is suitable using NPM/Bower.
- We want the code you submit to be written by you, so don’t use skelletons/generators.
- Make sure the application work on Node 5.x, NPM 3.x and in latest Chrome and Firefox.

When you are done, send us a link to your repository on Github/Bitbucket (preferred and much faster) through [this page](https://www.gaminginnovationgroup.com/careers/tech/javascript-developer/149276/) or [e-mail](mailto:rob@betitgroup.com) it directly to our CTO (not preferred, and much slower ;-).

Note, this is where you get to shine — _show us what you’ve got!_
